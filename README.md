# Multiplication-Mayhem
Project 1 for General Assembly


Multiplication Mayhem is a game designed to make learning multiplication tables fun.  In this game, the user helps the hero, Multiplication Man, try to defeat the computer, a villain named, The Calculator. The player is asked multiplication questions (times tables 1-12), and for every correct answer they input, The Calculator's health status bar is lowered. However, if the player answers incorrectly, Multiplication Man's status bar is lowered. Additionally, the user is only given a certain amount of time to answer the question. Once the allotted time is reached, the calculator displays the correct answer, and Multiplication Man's status bar is lowered. A winner is declared when either Multiplication Mastermind’s or The Calculator's respective status bars reachs zero.


#User Stories

This game was designed with two users in mind, students, and educators.


-From a student’s perspective, the game is simple and the instructions are clear.  They are written using language that one who is at the appropriate age to learn multiplication, but may be reading below grade level can understand.  
-The game has a comic book theme and there is a goal in mind other than learning multiplication, which ultimately makes the game more engaging. 
-As of right now, the speed of the game is tailored to the needs of the students with whom I’ve worked.  Therefore, the game is low stress and they do not feel like the computer has an unfair advantage.


-From an educator’s perspective, this game is an easy to use resource which eliminates the need to purchase or make, and then keep track of flashcards.  
-The instructions are simple which means that the majority of students can play on their own without the need for further guidance.  Additionally there is a prompt that checks to make sure that the player has read said instructions.  Although in comic sans, the text is written in the same size font typically used on a computerized standardized test.
-This game has no sound effects which means that there is no risk of this game being disruptive to other learning taking place in the classroom.
